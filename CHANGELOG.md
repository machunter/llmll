# CHANGELOG

## v0.2.0 — Phase 2b: Compile-Time Verification (2026-03-27)

### Compiler

- **`llmll verify <file>`** — new subcommand (D4). Emits a `.fq` constraint file from the typed AST and runs `liquid-fixpoint` + Z3 as a standalone binary. Reports SAFE or contract-violation diagnostics with RFC 6901 JSON Pointers back to the original `pre`/`post` clause. Gracefully degrades when `fixpoint`/`z3` are not in `PATH`.
- **Static `match` exhaustiveness (D1)** — post-inference pass `checkExhaustive` rejects any `match` on an ADT sum type that does not cover all constructors. GHC-style error with pointer to the missing arm.
- **`letrec` + `:decreases` (D2)** — new statement kind for self-recursive functions. Mandatory `:decreases` termination measure is verified by `llmll verify`. Self-recursive `def-logic` emits a non-blocking warning.
- **`?proof-required` holes (D3)** — compiler auto-emits `?proof-required(non-linear-contract)` and `?proof-required(complex-decreases)` for predicates outside the decidable QF linear arithmetic fragment. Non-blocking; runtime assertion remains active.
- **`LLMLL.FixpointIR`** — ADT for the `.fq` constraint language (sorts, predicates, refinements, binders, constraints, qualifiers) + text emitter.
- **`LLMLL.FixpointEmit`** — typed AST walker → `FQFile` + `ConstraintTable` (constraint ID → JSON Pointer). Auto-synthesizes qualifiers from `pre`/`post` patterns, seeded with `{True, GEZ, GTZ, EqZ, Eq, GE, GT}`.
- **`LLMLL.DiagnosticFQ`** — parses `fixpoint` stdout (SAFE / UNSAFE) → `[Diagnostic]` with `diagPointer` (RFC 6901 JSON Pointer) via the `ConstraintTable`.
- **`TSumType` refactor** — structured ADT representation in `Syntax.hs` replacing the previous untyped constructor list. Prerequisite for exhaustiveness checking.
- **`unwrap` preamble alias** — generated `Lib.hs` now exports `unwrap = llmll_unwrap`. Fixes `Variable not in scope: unwrap` GHC errors at call sites.
- **Operator-as-app fix** — `emitApp` now intercepts arithmetic/comparison operators used in `{"kind":"app","fn":"/"}` position and delegates to `emitOp`. Fixes `(/ (i) (width))` fractional-section GHC errors for integer division inside lambdas.
- **`.fq` constructor casing fix** — `emitDataDecl` lowercases ADT sort names and constructor names. Fixes liquid-fixpoint parser rejection of capitalized identifiers (e.g. `X 0` in `[X 0 | O 0]`).

### New Examples

- `examples/conways_life_json_verifier/` — Conway's Game of Life with verified `count-neighbors` and `next-cell` contracts
- `examples/hangman_json_verifier/` — Hangman with verified `apply-guess` pre/post
- `examples/tictactoe_json_verifier/` — Tic-Tac-Toe with verified `set-cell` bounds and `make-board` postcondition

### Spec (LLMLL.md)

- Header tagline updated: Phase 2b marked complete
- §4.2 `letrec` — new section documenting bounded recursion with `:decreases`
- §4.4 Contract Semantics — updated: runtime + compile-time enforcement described
- §5.3 — renamed "Verification (Phase 2b — Shipped)"; documents `llmll verify` command and qualifier synthesis strategy
- v0.2 changelog row in §14 rewritten to reflect what actually shipped (decoupled `.fq` backend, not GHC plugin)

### Schema (`docs/llmll-ast.schema.json`)

- `hole-proof-required` expression node added with `reason` enum: `manual | non-linear-contract | complex-decreases`

---

## v0.1.3 / v0.1.3.1

### Compiler

- **`first`/`second` pair projectors** — now accept any pair argument regardless of explicit type annotations. Previously a parameter annotated as any type (e.g. `s: string`) that was actually a pair would cause `expected Result[a,b], got string`. The `untyped: true` workaround is no longer required on state accessor parameters.
- **`where`-clause binding variable in scope** — `TDependent` now carries the binding name; `TypeCheck.hs` uses `withEnv` during constraint type-checking. Eliminates `unbound variable 's'` false warnings on all dependent type aliases.
- **Nominal alias expansion** — `TCustom "Word"` is now expanded to its structural body before `compatibleWith`. Eliminates all `expected Word, got string` / `expected GuessCount, got int` spurious errors. All examples now check with **0 errors**.
- **New built-ins** — `(string-trim s)`, `(list-nth xs i)`, `(string-concat-many parts)`, `(lit-list ...)` (JSON-AST list literal node).
- **PBT skip diagnostic** — `llmll test` skipped properties now distinguish between "Command-producing function" and "non-constant expression". `bodyMentionsCommand` heuristic narrowed to only genuine WASI/IO prefixes — eliminates false-positive skips on user-defined functions.
- **Check label sanitization** — `check` block labels containing special characters (`(`, `)`, `+`, `?`, spaces) are now automatically sanitized before being used as Haskell `prop_*` function names. Previously these caused `stack build` failures with `Invalid type signature`.
- **S-expression list literals in expression position** — `[a b c]` and `[]` are now valid in S-expression expression position (not just parameter lists). Desugars to `foldr list-prepend (list-empty)`, symmetric with JSON-AST `lit-list`.
- **`ok`/`err` preamble aliases** — generated `Lib.hs` now exports `ok = Right` and `err = Left` alongside the existing `llmll_ok`/`llmll_err`. Fixes `Variable not in scope: ok` GHC errors on programs using `Result` values.
- **Console harness `done?` ordering** — `:done?` predicate is now checked at the **top** of the loop (before reading stdin) instead of after `step`. Eliminates the extra render that occurred when a game ended.
- **`--emit-only` flag** — `llmll build` and `llmll build-json` accept `--emit-only` to write Haskell files without invoking the internal `stack build`. Resolves the Stack project lock deadlock when build is called from inside a running `stack exec llmll -- repl` session.
- **`-Wno-overlapping-patterns` pragma** — generated `Lib.hs` now suppresses GHC spurious overlapping-pattern warnings from match catch-all arms. Also extended exhaustiveness detection for Bool matches and any-variable-arm matches.
- **JSON-AST schema version `0.1.3`** — `expectedSchemaVersion` in `ParserJSON.hs` and `llmll-ast.schema.json` bumped from `0.1.2` to `0.1.3`. The docs already showed `0.1.3` in examples; now the compiler accepts it.
- **`:on-done` codegen fix** — generated console harness now calls `:on-done fn` inside the loop when `:done?` returns `true`, before exiting. Previously it was emitted after the `where` clause (S-expression path: GHC parse error) or silently omitted (JSON-AST path).

### Spec (LLMLL.md)

- **§3.2** — pair-type issues split into Issue A (pair-type-param, parse error, Fixed v0.2) and Issue B (first/second, Fixed v0.1.3.1)
- **§12** — check label identifier rule added; S-expr list-literal production documented
- **§13.5** — `lit-list` JSON-AST node and S-expr `[...]` syntax documented (v0.1.3.1+)
- **§10** — `:on-done` console harness note updated: callback now fires inside the loop, not after the `where` clause

## v0.1.2

### Compiler

- **Haskell codegen backend** — replaces the Rust backend entirely. Generated output: `src/Lib.hs` + `package.yaml` + `stack.yaml`, buildable with `stack build`.
- **JSON-AST input** — `llmll build` auto-detects `.ast.json` extension and parses JSON directly. Avoids S-expression parser ambiguities for AI-generated code.
- **`def-main` support** — new `def-main :mode console|cli|http` entry-point declaration generates a full `src/Main.hs` harness:
  - `:mode console` — interactive stdin/stdout loop with `hIsEOF` guard (no `hGetLine: end of file` on exit)
  - `:mode cli` — single-shot from OS args
  - `:mode http PORT` — stub HTTP server
- **`llmll holes`** — works on files with `def-main` (previously crashed with non-exhaustive pattern)
- **Let-scope fix** — sequential `let` bindings now each extend the type environment for subsequent bindings; unbound variable false-positives eliminated
- **Overlapping pattern fix** — `match` codegen no longer emits a redundant `_ -> error "..."` arm when the last explicit arm is already a wildcard
- **Both `let` syntaxes accepted** — single-bracket `(let [(x e)] body)` (v0.1.2 canonical) and double-bracket `(let [[x e]] body)` (v0.1.1, backward-compat) both compile to identical AST

### Spec (LLMLL.md)

- **§9.5 `def-main`** — fully documented: syntax, all three modes, key semantics, S-expression + JSON-AST examples
- **§12 Formal Grammar** — `def-main` EBNF production added; `def-main` added to `statement` production
- **§14 Migration notes** — corrected: both `let` forms are accepted; not "replaced"

### Examples

- Rust-era examples removed (`tictactoe`, `my_ttt`, `ttt_3`, `tasks_service`, `todo_service`, `hangman_complete`, `specifications/`)
- `examples/hangman_sexp/` and `examples/hangman_json/` added — both compile and run end-to-end
